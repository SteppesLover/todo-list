Have you ever used any AI tools (ex. chatGPT, Grammerly, Dall-E, etc.)? If yes, what did you use it for? If no, did you choose not to use AI, or you just haven't explored it/aren't aware of how to use it?
Yes. I have used AI to:
1. Translate text to my native language
2. Improve grammar and writing 
What did you think about your interaction with AI?
AI tends to provide common, generic ideas, which I donâ€™t always like. While you can ask it for more radical or unique responses, it still feels a bit formulaic.
What are ways you think AI can help you as you learn content throughout this class?
Sometimes you just lose power and you can use AI to translate text, improve your grammar and explain some context I missed. Like - "What does DOM means?"
What are ways that AI can cause frustration or negatively impact your learning?
In my opinion vibe coding is bad because instead of learning and using structures you just copy pasting code without understanding.
