So far in class, have you had any “aha” moments? What have you enjoyed the most? What has been the hardest?
While making summaries of the lessons, I’ve often had some “aha” moments, like: “Ohhh, that’s what they meant when they talked about this or that component.”
What were you excited/worried about before class started?
I’m actually worried now, because I want to complete the class as quickly as I can.
How do you feel about what’s still to come in this class and in your journey ahead?
I feel anxious. Will I be able to finish this class before the deadline for the next one? How many more classes can I take now?
