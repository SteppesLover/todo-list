How is collaboration used in your own family/culture/current workplace/etc.?
Collaboration is deeply tied to culture — different groups of people approach it in different ways.
In my family, we value independence. From the age of 8, I started helping my single mother raise four children. I had to solve many problems on my own.
In my culture, people are often reserved and not very open. However, if you're in a real emergency, they will step in to help. Still, people usually don’t trust each other easily.
I’m not currently working, but in my past experience, my American coworkers were kind and helpful. I tried to support them as well.
What’s one challenge you, personally, encounter while collaborating with others? What ideas do you have for overcoming that challenge?
My biggest challenge is admitting that I need help. I’m very stubborn and want to be smart enough to figure things out on my own. But I also want to become less prideful and more humble — someone who can accept help and is willing to ask for it when needed.
What’s one topic you want to start collaborating with classmates on this week?
Right now, I’m a bit ahead in the material, so I’m not sure how I can collaborate with my classmates. But I’d still be happy to support anyone who needs help.
