When was a time you got misinformation or bad advice? What happened? Also consider any time an artificial intelligence tool has given you bad/weird answers. Share about that experience here.
Well, the most common issue with advice is the lack of context. Different people have different needs, so my problems with advice usually happen when I don’t specify my request clearly enough. This also applies to AI tools — when I don’t provide enough details, the answers can be too general or even misleading.
What are some ‘clues’ that you use to help you assess whether a resource is applicable/trustworthy or not? What are some ways you can verify the information you got from AI was accurate/current?
I usually check the usefulness of resources by trying to implement the advice in practice. If it works and makes sense, I consider it trustworthy. When using AI, I often cross-check its suggestions with documentation or reliable sources to confirm their accuracy and relevance.
What are some ways you’ll build on your information literacy either in your personal life or as a developer?
Only practice can help build strong information literacy. As a developer, the more you code, the more you start to recognize which ideas and solutions actually work — and which don’t.
