Do you already have a problem solving process in place that you’ve found effective? If so, tell us about it!
Yes, I do! For me, it’s simple: keep trying until you figure it out. Experiment, ask questions, make changes — but keep going until it’s done. Persistence is the key.
How does problem solving show up through other hobbies or activities in your life?
I feel like I’ve mentioned this before, but video games have really helped me develop problem-solving skills. They’re a great space for experimenting and practicing decision-making. In RTS games, for example, you create a "snowball" effect by making a series of smart decisions until you complete the mission — just like solving complex problems in real life.
Have you observed others in the class solving problems differently than you do? What have you learned from their problem solving techniques?
Yes, I’ve noticed that some classmates have different approaches. One thing I’ve learned is the value of creating a productive environment. I’ve been successful in building a workspace that helps me focus better. Big thanks to Code the Dream for suggesting we work in public spaces — that advice really made a difference.
