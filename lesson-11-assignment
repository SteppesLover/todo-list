Think about a time when a layout personally impacted your experience (like the examples of bathroom signage or finding product details on a page) and describe the scene for us. Also share how you felt when you could/couldn’t find what you were looking for.
I don't really like websites with too many animations because they make the site less readable and too flashy. It becomes harder to focus on the actual content.
In the Adobe article, were there topics about layout that surprised you? If so, which one(s) and why?
For me, the topic about the Z and F reading patterns was interesting. It feels obvious once you understand it, but I had never thought about it consciously before.
What are some of your most favorite and least favorite design features as a user?
My favorite design features are clear visual patterns. My least favorite are excessive animations—they can be distracting and sometimes unnecessary.
Since you’re working with styling this week, try out some different background/foreground color combinations using this tool from A11y (another great accessibility resource). Are there any combinations that surprise you in terms of not meeting accessibility guidelines?
No, the combinations I tried all met the accessibility guidelines. I made sure to check the contrast and readability carefully.
