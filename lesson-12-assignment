Have you every felt Imposter Syndrome yourself and, if you’re comfortable sharing, how did it manifest itself? What, if anything, has helped you mitigate these feelings?
Yes, I have. It usually shows up as procrastination, avoidance, and fear of starting something new.
What helps me is taking time to "recharge" — once I regain energy, I feel more capable of overcoming obstacles again.
What do you think are some of the immediate or long-term effects of Imposter Syndrome if left unchecked?
It can lead to giving up. If you don’t address it, you might stop pursuing the things you really want to do.

Lesson-13-assignment:
Have you implemented/used any new strategies since the previous post on how to ask for help? If so what were they and how did they turn out for you?
Not really — to be honest, I’ve been focused on completing the lessons and moving quickly through the assignments, so I haven’t paused much to ask for help yet.
After reading the article what changes (if any) will you make to your strategy?
I'd like to become a more collaborative person — someone who’s comfortable asking for help when needed. Right now, I feel capable of working through things on my own, but I believe that in a real work environment, I’ll naturally become more team-oriented and open to seeking guidance.
What are some ways you can determine which “circle” (inner circle of things you know, middle circle of things you can figure out on your own, outer circle of things you don’t know and can’t learn by yourself) your blocker/bug/issue falls into?
Most of my issues are in the "inner circle" — they just require a closer look at my code and logic. That said, the “middle circle” is expanding thanks to the internet and AI tools, which help me learn and solve problems more effectively. These tools are helping me bridge the gap between what I know and what I’m learning.


Lesson-14-assignment:
Time to look back and look forward: When you started this particular class we asked you why you wanted to be a software developer and what you wanted to do with your skills after the class ends. Have your answers changed? What are your answers now?
Honestly, my answer is still the same: I want to become a skilled software developer. That goal hasn’t changed — if anything, it’s become even clearer.
What is your plan for the next:
3 months?
I plan to complete this course, then the Node.js course, and possibly take on a practicum. If I feel ready, I’ll also begin preparing for job interviews.
1 year?
I hope to grow into a confident and capable developer, ideally with a stable job in the industry.
5 years?
I want to start an educational initiative to help people in developing countries learn how to code and build tech careers. It’s important to me to give back and create access to opportunities.

Lesson-15-assignment:
Self-Gratitude (OPTIONAL ASSIGNMENT)
Make a gratitude list and acknowledge your accomplishments over the past few months.
I may not have finished the course as quickly as I initially hoped, but I’ve made consistent progress and kept moving forward — and that matters. I’ve learned a lot, grown more confident in my coding skills, and stayed committed to my goals.
I’m excited to continue improving and becoming a more efficient developer. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow, and I’m looking forward to the next course and challenges ahead!
